Unity Behavior Library
================

UnityBehaviorLibrary is a framework for creating behavior trees for game AI. 

It is a fork of https://github.com/NetGnome/BehaviorLibrary

This means that it makes use of .NET 2.0 and so some adjustments have been made.

The tests are written to use UnityTest.

For details on how to run the tests please see http://blogs.unity3d.com/2013/12/18/unity-test-tools-released/
